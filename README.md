# MetaWIBELE #

**MetaWIBELE** (**W**orkflow to **I**dentify novel **B**ioactive **Ele**ments in microbiome) is a computational pipeline that identifies novel bioactive microbial gene products from metagenomes and finds new immunomodulatory gene families, especially targeting secreted/extracellular proteins to enrich for likely host interactors. The prioritized list of gene products can be further used for downstream experimental validation.
